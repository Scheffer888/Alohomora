Project Summary:
This software object is to simulate the working of a safe box's lock mechanism. Using a combination of SW and Embbed computer(BeagleBone Black) over a purely mechanical device has several advantages. For example, this system has an easily configurable password and it is impossible to unlock it by "listening to the lock mechanism".


System inputs:
4 bits Absolute Encoder: 4 GPIO inputs


System outouts:
1 LED: 1 GPIO output
1 BBB internal LED.
